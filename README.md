## Theme Switcher

CampusPaws includes a powerful theme switcher that allows users to toggle between two distinct visual experiences:

### Available Themes

#### 🎨 Custom Theme (Default)

The vibrant CampusPaws branding theme featuring:

- Colorful gradients and animations
- Aceternity UI effects (sparkles, beams, animated gradients)
- Rich visual design with custom color palette
- Enhanced user engagement through dynamic effects

#### 🎯 Default Theme

A clean, minimal theme featuring:

- Standard shadcn/ui styling
- Neutral color palette
- No decorative effects
- Professional, distraction-free interface

### Key Features

- **Persistent Preferences**: Theme selection is saved in localStorage and persists across page reloads
- **Seamless Switching**: Instant theme changes without page refresh
- **Dark Mode Compatible**: Works alongside dark mode toggle
- **Accessibility**: Both themes maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios
- **Performance Optimized**: Conditional loading of theme-specific assets

### Usage

The theme switcher is located in the header navigation. Simply click the dropdown to select your preferred theme.

For developers:

```tsx
import { useTheme } from '@/contexts/ThemeContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { theme, setTheme, config } = useTheme();

  // Switch theme
  setTheme('default');

  // Check if effects are enabled
  if (config.effects.gradients) {
    // Render gradient background
  }
}
```
